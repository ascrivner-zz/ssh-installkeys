			ssh-installkeys

This script tries to export ssh public keys to a specified site.  It will
walk you through generating key pairs if it doesn't find any to export.
It handles all the fiddly details like making sure local and remote
permissions are correct, and tells you what it's doing if it has to change
anything.
